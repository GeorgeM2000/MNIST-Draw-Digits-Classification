# MNIST Classification Model
 This project is a classification model for the mnist dataset 
 which you can find in the tensorflow datasets. I have also 
 created a pygame window in which you can draw any number and 
 predict the resulting number. 

# Requirements
- Python 3.8 or newer versions
- Pygame 1.9.6
- TKinter
- Tensroflow
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Useful Information
One of the reasons that the process of predicting a number is not very effective, is because 
the images that already exist in the dataset may differ
from the ones that you provide in the pygame window. So the model isn't very accurate.
